there are only three reasons why things do not happen the way you want them to happen as a leader and you can look at a person and you would say either that person can't do which is a capability issue or they won't do which is a motivation or an alignment issue or they were not set up to do which is really your problem that you didn't set up the ways of working in a design properly so as a leader do you have the right people in terms of capability and if not is the right answer for us to coach them or to like really put them or Mentor them and so on or move them to some other place because maybe the capability suited elsewhere if they won't do why won't they are they not aligned to you do they not agree with your vision do they not have enough time and so on so forth so you need to really go deeper there why won't they do today my guest is Anuj rati I've been looking to get more India based product leaders on the podcast because this podcast has a large audience in India and

here and welcome to the podcast thank you so much Lenny thank you for having me it's my pleasure I haven't told you this but when I put a call out on Twitter and Linkedin for people's favorite india-based product leaders you were the single most recommended person and so I just wanted to start with how does it feel to be the most loved India based product leader at least according to my Twitter followers and Linkedin followers wow it feels uh it feels really really good and uh I really feel it's it's come together because I've been doing product management for the longest time in 2010 when I started uh the product management Journey with Flipkart I think that that was a time when there were not a lot of products being built for India so I think one part is is just the tenure and B is I think it's just a lot of people have known that work awesome you're very modest I wanted to start with a question about product in India and I'm just curious just how is product management and product building in general just most different in India yeah I think that's a very interesting question and I think about this all the time like uh when I look at product management in India and I do have like a lot of friends comparing product management versus say in us or even in Europe versus even in China southeast Asia Etc I think India has had like a very interesting journey of products in general and hence product management also I think till about 2010ish uh there were not really many products built for the Indian consumers in the first place place like there a lot of products being built a lot of Technology being built uh but largely because it was it was a back office so you were so you had like a lot of great Engineers but kind of working in companies which would build products for for the American customer or even for the European customer and so on so once these startups started coming in which were thinking about building for the Indian consumers uh I think we we did not really have that Talent which could which you could directly tap into who were trained into into product product building forget management as a field uh in the first place there were no colleges which were teaching anything about this there was no playbooks and so on so forth we would go to to the internet and look at YouTube and and look at svpg and all of that but uh what we would understand would not kind of you could not Port directly to the Indian startups uh and the way that they shaped up I think also shaped up the way product management field would evolve in India so it's it's taken like a bunch of iterations and I think there are like two or three different waves that have come in and we are way closer to how good product management should be done in India we still have a little bit way to go compared to to say us and I also think of it it it along like for example in us the product building culture probably started in 1970s the modern software product building culture and you didn't only have product managers but the entire ecosystem if you think about a company like who is the VP of Business and who is the VP of supply and sales and Ops and technology and all of that that group knew how to work with each other to build software products they understood how that would be built and what to expect I think in India when when we were in 2010 Etc even those different people who needed to come together to build like say e-commerce uh they would come from say fmcg or they would come from manufacturing and so on and what they would have seen in their Journeys in terms of what to expect is is a very request response kind of of understanding which is here's Machinery if I give this X resources I expect with a little bit of variability why predictable output to come and that mentality also kind of moved on to what I expect from product managers or product building Journeys and so on so I think over a period of time a lot of those Cycles have happened and a lot more other leaders in companies have have now seen those cycles and kind of understood and all right now I understand software is not Machinery uh consumers are not predictable as much as we thought and that has led to now finally I think product management coming of H you said that in the I guess in the Bay Area things started like 1970 or something like that when would you say things started to really ramp up in modern product thinking in in India I think 2010 was kind of when it started because uh look there were there were a few products that were built before that also and I think uh somebody said this clearly that usually when when modern consumer internet starts coming in countries it usually starts with travel so so you do have like basically any country we would start with which is the first travel company so I think India started with with some companies like make my trip and and so on like way earlier there were a few very interesting products being built in India which were solving uniquely for the Indian consumers uh that were in the matrimony side which is shadi.com and bhat matrimony.com and so on but like what do you think about Tinder like India is famous for arranged marriages so like a product that would that would really understand that hey if you are a parent if you want to get your kid uh you know up for M money how would you solve for them and that Marketplace of matchmaking Etc started so a few blips here and there which was soling uniquely for India I think 2010 was a decadal time when I can like very clearly imagine that's where like a lot of people started building for India so I think and Flipkart started that that kind of Journey but in a couple of years then they were like say Ola which was in a way similar to Uber what they were doing elsewhere and then a whole bunch of other startups that started coming in so for example in food delivery when I was working at swiigy that came in like say 2015 2014 in that time frame and and now you see a whole bunch of startups which are trying to do not only things which are what could an Uber for India look like or what what could a do dash for India look like uh very different and also very Innovative so so I think now is is a time when you see a lot more product building around that area what are some numbers of just like companies in India people in India's money spent in India I don't know things that would be like wow that is a much bigger opportunity than I thought all right this is um a very wide question so um I I'll tell you before the opportunity in India I think I'll talk about the complexity in India which is which is very uh which which I think a lot of people don't understand so India has what uh 1.4 billion people so there are three waves really that that happened in India but also in in the globe I think first wave was like from desktop to to mobile and then then even from Mobile to smartphones and from smartphones there was what we call the GE Revolution there's an Indian company called stance Geo that basically got internet at the cheapest prices for smartphones so because of this a whole population came onto the internet which was hungry for newer products newer content completely different ways of interacting with each other and using internet for all sorts of different things that was one of the Waves the other part is is really what the Indian government really enabled which is especially in um in digitization of a bunch of absolute core fundamental you know citizen related uh Machinery which is either through digital payments uh which is a whole bunch of Indians now started having a bank account by default and something called UPI so even if you do not have a bank account or that bank account is linked to your mobile phone number but now everybody would pay through that and that brought in like a very different kind of Revolution so even if five rupees that is basically like you know 10 cents or less than that that would be paid through UPI and and people started moving away from cash and so on and there's something called the India stack that is like all of these things coming together which is social security identity payments and so on that a whole bunch of other apps can now use to build their own um you know layers on top of that so many interesting cases kind of started coming about so that's kind of one which is just a number and in the infrastructure now the other thing to look at is India is very diverse so the number of languages spoken here even the official languages is is so high uh and they say there's this code in India like every 15 miles the language will change and the people and their culture will change and it's a huge country of of so many people so your traditional ways of thinking about products also that whom I building for is very different is are you building for this person or that Etc so a bunch of Frameworks kind of break down because it's not even that the same language will apply while English is a language that is used by the people at least who have the money and who have the the dollar to even like give to you but but you have to think way more widely the other thing that about India that is interesting is U the price that people are willing to pay so and it generally is also look at like the per capita you know money that people have is very low it's in the two2 and a half th000 range compared to us which is maybe for 30 times more and so on right so while there's lot of people who are going to give you you know traffic and engagement and so on but with the craft of of actually choosing the right kind of paying customer who will actually come and engage and give you money is is is at a premium so a lot harder work needs to be done if you're running e-commerce who are the people who will pay me delivery fee who are the people who will actually buy this expensive stuff and so a whole bunch of of different ways of thinking has evolved in in this country and and that's why it's so vibrant and so different than any any other Global products wow fascinating uh I can keep going but I want to talk product I've collected a bunch of questions from people that know you or people that have worked with you all about a bunch of different stuff so I'm just going to kind of go a little bit all over the place and the first area I wanted to talk about is the new new user experience apparently you have a interesting insight and kind of a different approach of thinking about new users and new user experiences one of the things that I realized once we started working about the products is that product managers and and generally companies are too engross in thinking about because they're very close to the product it's close to their heart and they're looking at it all the time they looking at a lot of minor nuances in terms of how this works and feels and almost inherent into this is the bias that everybody is thinking about this product all the day all the time and so on so forth whereas the reality is most consumers in the country or in your target market they don't care and they may have sometime heard about your product the word of mouth is not ever so strong even if you are the strongest brand and so on so forth but that is the the customer that you've got to bring in and then serve so there's very interesting Insight that I heard from Scott bsky um from Adobe and then now he's doing like very interesting stuff and that kind of stayed with me and which was you had to think about users or modern internet consumers having three attributes so they are lazy they are Vain and they're selfish so lazy meaning I don't have time for this so blow my mind away otherwise I'm not going to pay attention when which means I have a habit I'm solving this problem in a particular way and here you come with your two product and and asking me to change my habit do you really expect me to do that that's second that's their inherent attribute and the third one is that they selfish like show me what's in it for me and once you start thinking about users in that way and if these users are not even using your product like suddenly you realize oh my God it's quite difficult even how do I attract this kind of customer and if my marketing team has done a good job at bringing this user to my product how do I actually now empathize with this lazy selfish and M customer and build my product in a way so that I can make this we on your side like this is the thing that that you have to use the way you write your copy the way you build your on boarding the way you do your first warm welcome it it's going to make the biggest amount of change in terms of a product success than your core product features that you're going to build for your loyal consumers so that one insight and I've seen and applied that multiple times not only the companies that I worked with the companies I've consulted and and spoken with uh most neglected well they kind of get user on wording is important but just how important is that uh is one and B just a craft of thinking like a user who's lazy V and selfish and basically rejecting all your products this does not work for this kind of customer it's extremely hard it's very hard but it's totally worth it if you put that lens on and is there an example of you're using this framework at on a product you worked on where you're just like here's the thing we really did that I I don't know had a big impact or really surprised everyone so I we used it in in like two different areas so one is uh of course products I worked on so I worked in in swiy for the last seven years and really when we started working towards this user instead of thinking about everybody as a as as you know this is what our onboarding experience looks like and this is what our product is so essentially we used to basically say key uh that it's we are a food delivery app we are a grocery delivery app and we have like these bunch of things instead of that we just started reframing it from the from the point of view of what would you want and how could you use us and what is it in in it for you and we started connecting all our marketing messages along with the onboarding so even going out market and thinking where do you actually find us how did you know about us it's a reasonably large brand why have you not already downloaded us and used us have you used us and rejected Us in the past so kind of building that enti mental model and looking at a a user from the point of view of let's assume that you have heard about us 20 times and what was that exact situation that brought you to download this app so right from the entire journey of of you hearing us what was a trigger and what was the marketing message and what was the promotion that we were running and how do we continue that Journey on your onboarding from your slash that 200 rupees of of X rupees if you buy from us continuing that entire journey in the language that they understand and with the user experience that is continuation from the marketing to product are the things that we started focusing on a lot more and it instantly started uh like you know showing us results but while I'm talking about like just a very simple example and everybody should be doing it that is true even for uh when you have an have a part particular app which has multiple products and many product lines it's the same principle that applies there and that's where I think the largest amount of Delta that happens that people don't know really why are we not able to cross-pollinate or cross sell and so on so forth right now I'm working with a company called Jupiter which is uh a financial services app and it's a Neo bank so we care for personal finance and it has a bunch of offerings like there's a personal account or savings account uh there's a credit card there's mutual funds there is investments in in say gold and FB and and so on so forth like it's a bunch of things but when people think about why are you using Us only for one service and just go away actually the key is to recognize that this user has found value in and they're not interested in all the other things that you talked about so be able to empathize with that user and now thinking about like the Behavioral Science aspects in terms of how do I convert this user from one to the other that I think is uh is extremely important so a couple things I'm hearing here one is the importance of focusing on not people currently using your product but this idea of maybe the marginal user or the adjacent user like the next state of users is who you should be thinking about when you're trying to optimize onboarding user experience and then two is something it sounds like you've had a lot of success with is picking one value prop maybe one positioning statement and then following that through their entire Journey versus like herey all the things we do is that right that's absolutely right let me give an example of of this one right like uh and one of the reasons why really feel product managers must if not better but equally understand uh category consumers which are not in Market or which are not really looking or which are not buying your products just yet as good as the the marketer or the or the brand expert in your team does because they really are tased with what is that one message that I can say that will make the user take attention or or get to like oh this interesting and and and direct attention towards your product and if the product managers are able to do that then they will choose that positioning and essentially understand what is my hook product and what is the hook that will at least get them to try my my app or or any of those things right so if they understand it as well as a marketer and then understand over a period of time what is the right time when I introduced them to this other one rather than being you know very greedy about like letting the new user try everything so that's one uh the other thing that I feel is a lot of product managers don't do right is forget about everything here's my app go figure is is is is how most of of the products are designed unfortunately uh that automatically these things will happen without any intervention I have created something which is so beautiful and once you tap that icon everything inside that is my product that is so working perfectly uh but they don't really think about at what moment do I actually get this user here and why will they use it but this user is lazy rain and selfish that phrase reminds me of something I always think about Mark andreon had this great quote that your user time is already allocated they're not like looking for more apps to download they already have a plan for the day basically they have things to do they're not like it's another iPhone app I'm going to check out right now and so somehow you have to convince them this is worth your time and I like this this framework is there like an example of like a phrase you found really effective in other either it's Wiggy or Jupiter or flip cart or anything just like here's a really quick example of something that had a big impact on either simplifying the value prop or if you don't have an example top of mine what was kind of the impact you saw from implementing some of these ideas I'll talk about like a phrase that uh that now I use with with product managers a lot to kind of simplify how they should be thinking I think one thing is uh and that's not only for the consumers but even like how how we operate that we are product managers and we are in the business of influence uh users are doing something and now we want them to do something else our Engineers are doing something and now we want to influence them into building something fast our lead leadership has some plans we to influence them to essentially look at a plan and like basically sign off and do something else we are in the business of influence and you are doing this all the time internally otherwise you are anywh not successful even in shipping now we have to extend this to our users and really think about it from that point of view and so you are a full stack influencer and not only an external influencer so you got to think like more like sales more like marketing more like influencers one of the most important skills of product manager influencing people on their team and I like the point that you're also trying to influence your user that's interesting just more reason to get really good at influence so I actually have a newsletter about how to get better influence based on froto Baggins and Lord of the Rings to that in the show notes okay let's shift to a different topic you have a really concrete way of actually implementing the working backwards process we had one of the authors of the book working backwards on recently and I'm excited to just hear what you've learned about how to actually put this into practice it's easy to hear about let's work backwards but doing it as a different beast and so I'd love to hear what you've learned there well I think the the people who invented working backwards is clearly Amazon I think they they started this entire process which are like hey why don't write a press release and with that press release we'll work backwards from from from that one and I thought that was a very cool idea and I was trying to dig down into like hey how why does it work um my insight or at least my the way that I thought about this one is it's not working backwards only from a customer value proposition will our customers love love it and will they pay for it and is it noteworthy and is it something that we should even be working while that is one of the most important things uh that the working backwards framework teaches us but essentially what you're working backwards from is is an entire Machinery at a particular day that is working for for that date of GTM what do we need to do from here till that particular day so that that GTM is successful but also what will be the Machinery we would have created so that this product is successful uh now because you're already talking about GTM you're already thinking about how will users love it what is the money that we'll spend what are the altern that we will routes that we have explored that finally we have zeroed and on and all of those so they are all going to be a part of a prf if I take a slightly open stance on this one what is a press release a press release is you have a one pager which talks about what are we building what is a particular date why what is exact value proposition what will consumer say what is what will the business manager say what will uh how will they respond how will they uh use it but the one thing that comes out from this framework is that you can use it for a whole bunch of other things you can use it for negotiation for example because you start with a date and then you say this is the one page that I need to ship and I want consumers to say that and you can use it to now go to our VP engineering and say by this date can we build all of this now they do not have all the PS and everything but they can give you a sense that you know this is too aggressive or this is not and so on you can also use the quotes here to actually find alliances or find like people who are going to actually derail this so you actually use the customer code to basically I want my customers to say this from marketing and from my uh pricing team can we actually ship this so the consumers will say that and then from the business owners quote you actually say this is what we shipping but what are your goals can you say that within three months we would have achieved this much and so using that to kind of build one entire picture is is is one way that I found it really powerful because if you find disagreements here then say I can't ship it then you change the date and and then you change the goals because all of these things are changing together so instead of one you find the other set of all the things that need to come together to for that press release to go live is the real value the other part that I found interesting here is that I really truly believe in the power of three so I I I actually ask my teams to write three PR releases alternative and Divergent like what if we so suppose your launching membership program so instead of two tiers let's do three tiers or or for example let's SE another one which says instead of uh you know building a membership let's build a tiering pricing program which with membership points and instead of this segment we let's use another segment let's say within these three and they all need to be fully taught through and that kind of helps the leadership choose so the two things that help uh that work here when you are in the in the product Discovery phase you would have heard from a lot of folks and and finally if you show them just one road map uh it feels like hey this person didn't they listen to my interesting point which was valuable but they didn't include it but when you're doing this three prfq I saying them I considered this and this added up to a story that eventually is valuable this alternative I considered your point of view and I created a story but unfortunately it's not adding up so we rejected it so now people can compare and contrast and that's a very powerful leadership tool and that actually is a very power powerful tool even for cxos when they say let's build this and say here are three ways we can build this and here's the reason why I'm not building what you said because you would like these two more that's a really cool idea of just using the prfq and working backwards process to think very differently partly to make sure you've explored all the options partly to just like think through things that are kind of in the back of people's minds and see if there's something there before committing to the One Direction so the fq also are very important to kind of set processes in the system for example if now we are Jupiter we Financial Services app so every fq will mandatorily have how are you going to make sure that it is fully compliant have you gotten sign off from from ABC people have you actually thought about legal aspects and so on so forth so for example you can use the F very effectively here uh what as for example when it was swiy and it is uh it's a three-way Marketplace you have consumers delivery Executives and restaurant Partners now any small change that you do on on say delivery partners for example if you're working on optimizing their earnings per hour which will lead to some changes in cost per delivery but that may have a completely different impact on delivery fee I'm just making this up but uh now because of so many moving Parts in your FAQs you'll be explicitly asking have you thought about what are the implications on restaurant par have you thought about what are implications on delivery partners and we in fact we also have that prfq in terms of we'll write down the different segments of of delivery partners and sometimes it will have extremely weird correlations because just the product managers on one side of the equation have started thinking or at least Consulting uh the other part of the of the marketplace what could this mean for you and just it gets everybody together to to create very crisp products that work for all sides of the marketplace one thread I'm pulling out a few of your stories so far is you often come back to this like full stack approach to many models so you talked about how PM is like an influencer but also they're influencing users it's a cool way of thinking about it with this working backwards process you can use it to think about the full sta of launch not just what features you're going to build I know you also have some strong opinions about product managers and they should be much more full stack than most PMS does that ring a bell and if so can you talk about that yes uh no I think it's it's it's the same thread that is connecting the first and the second uh I think product managers have to be have to own outcomes and and not only features and and parts of the problem well they will own some parts of the problem fully but if they need to work with everybody to make sure that eventual product that they launch is successful and and not only successful from the point of view of he we launch something that works for users Etc that's not the definition of success did it work in the way that it really changed the behavior of the kind of user that we wanted to it achieve a business outcome they build a capability that is important for us all of those things combined will not happen if the product manager is only thinking about their part so they have to think about externally users they have to think about competition they have to think about other product managers and product leaders about engineering about marketing and so on because it's such a diverse field unless you really and I'm not saying you need to be an authority of that unless either you you are very very good at that or you have built Partnerships and have run your ideas or or product through those people and got waed from them and finally made a decision around that part I don't think you'll be very successful so in my opinion the full stack product managers are the ones who are going to be more successful rather than U product managers who are doing very good at one particular area only if so there's one book which is range right I'm sure like you may have heard about it right even the first chapter what they talk about uh is they take two examples one is the example of uh Federal Roger feder so with Roger feder for example I think I'll just continue that that till 18 he played like a bunch of Racket Sports uh and this wasn't even tennis then you bring in you know ideas from one racket sport to the other and second to the third and so on so forth and now you have such a range of ideas that you can connect a lot more dots and actually Shipe it like I think that's the that's a better playbook for being more successful in product I was just watching a documentary on I think it was called greatness and they had Wayne Gretzky and he had exactly the same experience actually when he was young he played hockey just during winter times and during summer he played other sports and hockey was just like s like a sport one sport he played and then eventually started to focus on it and they talked about how people that play different sports in their childhood actually ended up being much better at that one sport they chose so a lot of parallels I know you also have a lot of interesting ways of thinking about coming up with road map ideas and ideating and building a road map backlog so you already talked about this idea of going in very Divergent directions and seeing if that leads anywhere there's a couple more I someone shared uh one is you have this idea of show don't tell what is what is that actually shun Del is is an idea which is an extension of what we were talking about is uh from working backwards and when we're talking about working backwards U one is a prfq which is like a written documentation of what we're trying to achieve show don't tell is essentially a way in which the product manager starts ideating with the entire experience and they actually create all the collaterals collaterals together of a user journey to begin with if you're working on a single player product which is a single user product and then you actually start bringing together your marketers and others and terms of what is literally the first screen and how is my user getting here and it's not as simple as we imagine somebody who will be doing this and reaching here we try to recreate an exact situation uh there's a concept of person not personas so I'll we talk about personas but we try to go to all right no don't think about a generic user let's say Lenny 30 years old doing ABCD things earning this much etc etc his relationship with this category of food delivery is X these are the things that he has done in the last month in the last three days there were the needs desires aspirations fears frustrations etc etc we take okay it's 11:00 what's happened why is this user open or what triggered this particular app and then what happened so you literally start from there and I think 50% of my product reviews are are around that part and then when we say all right then this app got open do we have the right kind of way forwards for Lenny to actually achieve what he came here for and literally each pixel and each copy and each word is is going to be in service of of that part so that's kind of showing the entire Journey rather than just saying and assuming uh so that is something that I found really powerful with respect to even designing products or even thinking about why are we building something what it also helps is when we are building complex products especially in marketplaces because once you building this for the user simultaneously something is happening on the other part if it is simultaneous if it's a real-time Marketplace or something like that so you're building something for the user and saying all right if this guy ordered now there's a 30 minutes time when a delivery Executives will will will come to come to the user with food what is happening what's the emotional state of the user and let's plot out the 30 minutes time and let's create like various scenarios is is like hey maybe he went to the restaurant and and the food is delayed or the dude on a bike uh his bike got punctured Etc what is a consumer thinking at this time so you show all of those things in real time and that kind of cuts out a whole bunch of um of you know random ways in which the product could have looked like if you're creating even a chat bot so just having that showcase of all Journeys coming together uh helps a lot in building your products in the right way so essentially just getting very detailed and very concrete with the product experience that you're building thinking about the user experience sounds like a lot of work I can't imagine you do this often is the advice here to do this once a year or once and just kind of keep it updated sounds like you did this at swiggy and that was a really impactful way of building the product yeah I think I think this not only like one way aty I think like I recommend this every product manager to do a show don't tell version of their current version and at the same time this is a new version all the time so they can compare and contrast and very easily kind of explain everyone why they're doing something in fact that wall say it's called the wall it also becomes one common place where you can get all the stakeholders in uh because it becomes instead of just doing the elevat P you can actually do detail discussions on why I'm choosing this versus something else and so on so forth that's a product manager version of doing this there's also product leaders version of doing this L which is which I call strategy on a page and a lot of people call it like growth Loops like don't show a user Journey now let's see the entire strategy of the company together on one page all right this is what the market looks like and why will we get what kind of users and what is our activation budgets and how how many of them are we going to get to this next stage and get them to use it how will we get them to cross pollinate into different sections do we need a membership program are there any different lever which we'll press more or less and so on so that also is like a show don't tell um and not only one but usually I like to create three of them as well like why did we choose a strategy versus the other and that for example is like a very good way for product leaders to kind of get two1 strategy that their cxos align with and something that they can essentially tell the entire product and other teams this is what we're going to follow this episode is brought to you by Wix Studio your agency has just landed a dream client and you already have big ideas for the website but you have the tools to bring your ambitious Vision to life let me tell you about Wix Studio the new platform that lets agencies deliver exceptional client sites with maximum efficiency how first let's talk about Advanced design

workspace the ReUse of assets across sites the seamless client Handover and that's not all find out more at wix.com Studio what kind of impact have you seen from implementing something like this or is there an example of something that came out of this that was a big unlock and you know again it's probably a lot of work for someone to put together a whole board keep it updated screenshots marketing funnel of where people are coming from what sort of impact do you see from doing this either on growth or people what people think I think the largest impact that happens here is on alignment so how cxos are thinking if that is not very clear and that can be a document and so on so forth but for a lot of people it's not very clear on I can see one part of the funnel I can understand the marketing team can understand the best why we are requiring those users but they don't kind of fully see the picture of if I attract this kind of users why will some these users become loyal and what does that entire thing look like or say some other team which is building a part of the product where do I come in and so on so I think the largest impact that the show don't tell uh tell has is on basically getting the entire company together on the same page and and then being able to understand why I'm doing and which part of the entire uh you know picture I am working on and why others are working on so that I can actually work with them to solve that part um that's one the other thing that that it helps uh Lenny is it also helps in choosing directions like I said like it's because we are not doing one but three of them and why I'm choosing one alternative versus the other and sometimes these strategic discussions they can get go in like all sorts of different ways and maybe you'll talk about one particular unique point and go deeper I look at the entire picture together and say this is good because of all of the these five points that we presented in in in page one versus the other one I think the other benefit just like one of the benefits of working backwards and Amazon's whole written down memo approach is it forces you to crystallize ideas and not stay superficial because there's so many like good ideas in theory but then when you have to get really concrete now that's actually a terrible idea like basically it's the same benefit in a lot of ways of like get very concrete what do you actually going to do and that'll help you identify okay this isn't going to work what are we even thinking and so so I like that awesome okay another framework that you have is something that you call the 4bb framework for product strategy can you talk about what that's all about we essentially saw that you know um if if a startup actually usually wants to do like a bunch of of of things across the board uh there's always like hey I should be investing in Tech debt or like building core platforms that would really help my product in the long term and that's super important and that's my engineering managers and largely people asking for that bandwidth and then there is the product manager themselves who is basically saying I want to do feature enhancement Buck fixes my version tools uh you know a few areas experiments and so on so forth that's a a regular product backlog that you would work on on Sprint by Sprint uh then there's this leadership which will say you know what now we have a suite of products now I want to take like a large you know Delta bet that may work uh it may not work but uh but we need to make make sure that it works and but I need work done across teams and it's not only one person that needs to do it I need contribution from four or five of of you that that come together and deliver that or there are places where a company is like just reimagining their identity uh or they're pivoting which is like all right we were doing X now we are doing X+ y that's how we want to be known or we were doing X now we want to do very little of X because current consumers okay we will take care of them but now we want to Pivot into y right so it usually is in in these in four of these buckets and what really happens is it gets down to product managers eventually prioritizing between these four so I don't think it's a tactical prioritization product manager call it really is a product strategy call and the conversation that needs to happen is between say the head of product and the CEO or or even like the the leadership if I gave you 100 Focus points how much will you put in each of these buckets and what are those four buckets those are the four BB buckets uh so what are the ones we call them first BB is brilliant Basics uh the reason why we call it BB brilliant basic you need to brand you cannot brand it as St debt so it feels like very off because these are brilliant these are important that's for the companies built on and the company needs to in invest in that so that's one the second one is bread and butter so we that's your backlog say if the product managers had no big ideas and they just were left on their own what would they come up with and in terms of just improving that line of business that that they that they given then there big bets and now that's where you're um you know larger ideas that have come together but how many big bets should we take or or is this big bet even a big one that's where you're working backwards or prfq start becoming even more important uh because those are the kind of bets that cannot be taken without everybody basically signing up working backwards and saying we will all make this successful uh and Breaking Bad essentially is a different world altogether that's where you want to redefine your company you were doing um for examp in SW we were doing food delivery now we want to do grocery delivery as well it's like a these are two companies working together or from a food delivery company we wanted to become a convenience company so that's almost Breaking Bad like we again like I said we got cheesy uh but the good thing that happens is is now what you can do is along with your leadership take stock and the head of product essentially can say you know what I can in this in the next year I can invest a lot less on my brilliant Basics and we should as a company focus a lot on this breaking back because that is existential but then we should not look back and say why would Tech Systems a little bit broken this time why were uh you know we had a little bit more down times and you can basically blow it out and and almost showcase what to expect or for example if we are just working on a whole bunch of bread and butters so start seeing a lot fewer bugs customers will be a little happier you worked a lot more brilliant Basics tech systems are nice but you didn't create any differentiators uh well none of your bets went out and and your competitors are catching up so does that sound like a a better future these are hard questions and these prioritization questions I don't think are product management questions so much as product strategy questions but in a lot of cases Executives don't know what they're trading off against so if you are able to uh create the conversation around which buckets do we want to put in and create three Alternatives I have kind of tried to do that a bunch of times let's look at strategy a and this see how to be Divergent suppose we were putting like lot fewer uh you know Focus points in brilliant Basics and a lot more on for example big bets then there will be a risk that they will be like we won't have any experiments or very less experiments we won't have your bugs will stay bugs we won but we will get a shot at like kind of changing the game is that a future that is that sounds better or something else which is like because you're pained also by a lot of bugs and you know constant down times so which is more secure but we won't build something amazing so which sounds better because you are able to drive that now the clarity to the product managers is way clearer in terms of what will they do and also they would know that if they are they have been signed up for a big bet then they will need to contribute to the prfq they will need to contribute to the actual uh you know working of that irrespective of what their product was but now they're part of something bigger awesome I love it okay so just to summarize so people can have a just a very short definition of this framework uh brilliant Basics is essentially Tech debt and like things that just have to do to like hygiene almost bread and butter is essentially optimizing the product the existing product big bets are big bets and breaking bat are just like future big rocket like Moon shots just like transform the way the business works that's right I love it it's also interesting another thread that can comes up again and again in your advice is exploring all the options before committing to one like you always I think sounds like you always try to recommend three I guess let me say what I always find is important there is I think it's important for the product manager to recommend one along with that it's not just like here's three you tell me which one you do it's like here's three here's my recommendation why is that your advice too or do you see something 100% 100% uh so when you have explored the three you essentially have done the work on that I have covered all bases and also crystallized them into into an a concrete option and now I'm choosing one on the company's behalf on the basis of whatever I know about the market about the company about our strategy and about how we will make it successful now if I miss something it's also a time where you can actually work with leadership and other product managers to essentially get that knowledge complete or if if there are like if you're 80% right you can actually use elements of strategy 2 and strategy 3 to bring into one so that's always the uh the way that that you think that one very concrete option but because you have these other two so that you're not missing and bringing it together but ultimately you the one who is going to Champion this and that's where the other uh you know leadership element of Amazon comes in which is disagree and commit so but once we have aligned on this one we'll all commit to to launching this and then the leadership should not go back and forth on that part awesome I want to go in a completely different direction feels like you have a lot of contrarian opinions about how to build product and how to build teams and build companies and things like that so I just want to start broad what are some things you have contrarian opinions about things you believe that a lot of other people maybe don't believe or see differently so one for example excellence and speed there's always like a question around that hey would you rather ship faster or would you sh rather ship better in my opinion when when you have to make a choice think more and ship better most experiments should be thought experiments they should not even be tried out because they're obviously going to fail which is contrary to let's try it out and then let's see I think that Wast a lot of company time if you had uh if you had smart people who could do meta thinking a lot of experiments would just not even be live it's not a rule but it's a preference I think speed and Excellence are two different axis ideally you should be better at both but if you had to choose one choose Excellence there's another contrarian opinion uh which is I think most most product managers and again I'm probably talking a little bit of of of the kind of you know people that I've worked with and and and I've kind of interacted with in product most product managers should not even be product managers they should think a little bit more around whether this is actually the right field for them because I think a lot of people from other areas have entered the field without fully realizing what it takes so there is definitely a way in which you can coach yourself and and and and kind of work your way upwards of that one but it's it can make you quite miserable if you not kind of if it's not right for you is there something folks should look forward there that'll tell them you probably shouldn't be a product manager either motivation or skill set or background or anything no I don't think about like particular U domains that you come from I have like again a simple framework of three I think the first thing is is essentially raw Sharps and that can manifest itself into problem identification and problem solving that's one and also high and all of that I that is super important the second one is what I call drive or grit because I think with that comes a whole bunch of qualities around curiosity learnability never giving up consumer back thinking I really want to solve this and all of that that that comes with that third which is a little difference we talked about that is influence you're in the business of influence and if you can kind of see yourself that I'm I'm built this way or I want to really get better at these that's when I think this field is is going to serve you well I love that everything is three how handy only the babies are four I I wish I could comess in three yeah there's too many things to do there essentially these are your maybe your perspective on the most important PM skills that a good way to think about it influence grid and just being smart and I think what you said here is not like you have to be amazing at these to get into product and do well it's you need to be excited about getting better at skills that's right because I think uh it's it's not as if that everybody is born with like a lot of influence like of course you can get better rated but it's just a prospect of of that hey I will need to be influential to succeed at this job that should excite you and not scare you away and you should not like think um that hey you know what I can get away from this and still be very successful product manager because most likely you will know maybe spending a little more time here so smart you're probably not going to be able to do a lot about in terms of grit or influence is there anything you can share about what you've seen most helps people develop at these skills other than just doing the job for a while and then starting to get better at this yeah I think even even smartness I think 80% of that smartness I think is something that's that's very achievable you don't need to be outstanding on that domain knowledge for example is something just like an average smart person with person with no domain knowledge versus you with armed with a lot of knowledge around domain and so on can already take you there where you can take better decisions I think first one is more about decision making problem identification problem solving and all of that so I think that really can be developed at least to a level where you are very effective Drive I think is is probably the hardest to coach probably the hardest I've not seen people with with less Drive actually eventually turning out with with a lot of Drive Etc but but they can be inspired and I think you need to be a person who can can think about it that way but the third one influences I think like there's no negotiation there you need to really think that I have to be good at this one there's another framework that Len I wanted to talk about and uh when I look at like product leadership in general and how how do you think about uh you know different people and and so on why is it when is it a product manager problem or your problem or the company problem there are only three reasons again why things do not happen the way you want them to happen as a leader U and you can look at a person and you would say that either that person can't do which is a capability issue or they won't do which is a motivation or an alignment issue or they were not set up to do which is really your problem that you didn't set up the ways of working in a design properly or your okay our structure success and so on so forth so as a leader it's it's almost the opposite of what like what we talked about crit influence and R shops like if the have you do you have the right people in terms of capability and if not is the right answer for us to coach them or to like really put them or Mentor them and so on or move them to some other place because maybe their capability suited elsewhere if they won't do why won't they like are they not aligned to you do they not agree with your vision do they not just have enough time and so on so forth so you need to really go deeper there why won't they do and there are different answers for that but if it's a setup issue and at least I realized that apart from what product managers can do almost 70 80% of problems why things don't happen are a setup issue uh product leaders or other leaders have not thought through what okrs are doing to my company not really fully thought through around Aug design if you have read the book called team topologies that's like one one interesting book which which starts with convey law and essentially saying show me an engineering architecture and I will actually tell you what the a design of of this company is but that also manifests itself in products you can basically look at a product in most cases you'll be able to say what was or design that L to this kind of product I've heard that book mentioned a couple times recently I got to check it out just to uh the three you just shared which is another three I love it can do won't do what was the third one again and didn't do not set up to do not set up to do that one's a long that's a long one I think what's cool about these are it they're essentially ways to measure performance maybe of a product manager like performance review it's like can did you have the skills to do this did you have the motivation to do this or did something not set up for you sucess like you weren set up for Success basically okay let's go to AI Corner something I'm trying to do with every guest is there anything you've learned about working with AI that you think might be helpful to listeners yeah I think a couple of things uh I think working with AI many many many teams and companies get too excited about Ai and the possibilities and so on and it's almost like a solutionary to find a problem within their companies which also is fine because now you're thinking about possibilities on on what what this particular technology can do for my company so it's a good way to start but many people don't actually use it in the best way possible and and force fit it instead of that you can think about how do I get AI to work with hi and again it's connecting back with and this is something that s Hara invented this term called hi just to make sure that everybody understands artificial intelligence intelligence is important as much as human intelligence and if you're not humanly intelligent you're not going to be artificially intelligent or AI really help company a lot so literally any product that you're building even when it is technologically you know quite interesting and exciting and so on it needs to be balanced out and work together along with a great ux along with behavioral signs and the and the combination of those two will actually make sure that that you're getting the best outcome of that unless you are building something which is like completely back in with no human intervention that talk about consumer products largely you've helped build some of the most successful marketplaces in India and in the world I'm curious just what may be a lesson or two about building a successful Marketplace one thing that that I would I would definitely want to talk about is when you're thinking marketplaces it's not as a 1 plus 1 equals to two it multiplies and we thinking about threeway marketplaces you almost not need to think like it's a two-dimensional plane going into three dimension like it becomes that amount of complexity and your regular product management and Leadership principles kind of start failing so a bunch of Usual Suspects will not not work let me give an example oks will not work uh why not so fundamentally okrs are a way to think about objectives and key results but the fundamental assumption here is that it is solving for a kind of user uh and that kind of user you can divide and conquer and of course there will be like a little bit of tussle between different teams but you can get them to work with each other but if it is working for three different kind kind of users then all the goals will all the time be in conflict with with each other and what are examples of the three users there's like the delivery person the restaurant and user so if you have if you have an example of uh on the consumer side we need to collect more delivery delivery fee or what does that really mean for those other two and on the restaurant side hey we we need to get more commissions because profitability is a goal and on the delivery partner side it means pay them less optimize a little bit more so but once you start moving one level those two are already stretched towards the other direction so they are not independent levers in the first place and and the way to even model them out how will it work out if we choose X versus what y will change y on z z will change it's almost impossible to do that so I've seen okas F multiple times when you're running this kind of a Marketplace big bets work much better that's when you say heyy we want to take this bet but it's all going to be it's all going to come together as if we pull this ler then something else will change so here's the entire story of let's go make this profitable by making delivery fee higher but maybe not touching earnings per hour maybe not touching restaurant commissions things like that so I've at least found that's a that's a better way to you know choose strategically which direction we have to go the other thing is um managing multiple empathies together that's not not straightforward so again swiggy being like a realtime hyperlocal Marketplace and we discussed about that right as soon as the order comes what happens between when user does this and when delivery executive is doing something else and what are the absolute different kind of scenarios that are going to be faced by by the delivery executive uh and at the same same time how will I really you know work with the user to manage their emotions so so you need to manage a whole bunch of these things together um and product management here you you cannot have the delivery executive product manager only care about that side they also need to be a champion on the consumer side and vice versa yeah I find with marketplaces Uber went through this Li went through this where the like the supply often just gets squeezed because they need to deliver for the customer so like drivers end up getting hosed you know airb be hosts kind of get pushed to do things they may not want to do imagine delivery people same thing not that you mentioned Uber for example one of the things that um that that companies which were running you know know taxi businesses if you have just one limited pool of money for example and you want to get the marketplace coming with respect to number of orders per day uh how do you decide should I incentivize my users for example for the first ride first 10 R and so on or put zero money in there but incentivize my drivers that you need to come here so you have to think about liquidity also in in in very different ways and and sometimes you need to pull the lever completely uh towards the other side so the experiments Al AB experiments also don't work and that's a very unique thing about Marketplace and not work I mean not work in the way that you would expect them to work uh because there are network effects all over so if you have to run a experiments on your driver side uh if you put half drivers on a versus half on B but there is a network effect uh between the both of them when you're trying to decide which side of the marketplace to focus on and prioritize do you have any kind of lons or rules of thumb of just like focus on the customer and index towards their happiness versus the supply versus say the delivery person the one thing that every that I think marketplaces need to realize is that a you need to be operating in a stable Marketplace so all sides need to be stable enough so that they're not going to go away so I think that's a starting point and that's an important point because once we have established that then after of stable Marketplace then we say that which are the uh which is the kind of customer that we're in the service of and which are the customer that we will really focus on for example Amazon is very very clearly a customer Centric company and if they have to make a choice they won't because they need to have a stable Marketplace so sellers also are very as important but slightly more important than the customer but for example if you looked at say Tabo or in Alibaba their way of thinking is their aim in life is to create life-changing experience for 10 million Chinese Sellers and they will create a market Market Place from the point of view of sellers which can actually sell again they will have the same consumer app and uh and a seller you know work and so on they are in in the service of of sellers so you need really need to it will derive from the company's Vision I think the way we had thought about it at that we had to clarify in our values that the first value is initially it used to be customer comes first but that was very confusing because everybody is a customer even restaurant is a selling customer um and so on we had to clarify consumer comes first like the end consumer which is actually eating food because we a convenience company uh that delivers to the end consumer and when you're thinking about you know restaurants or delivery partners and we work with them because we both are when you're talking with the with the delivery partner swiggy and the delivery we both are in the service of the customer so you'll build that app also from that perspective and even the restaurant side also from that perspective that you know we both are together in the service of the End customer I feel like you have probably a hundred more Frameworks and processes and acronyms we can talk about but uh I know you got to go is there anything else you wanted to touch on or is there anything else you want to leave listeners with before we get to our very exciting lightning room just last few words that that want to revise work backwards from an amazing future so first thing is creatively imagine a future and then work backwards from that and essentially think what will make that successful and be paranoid about that hey everything is going to go wrong and hence I need to just make sure that it all comes together only the paranoids survive great advice to leave people with we reached our very exciting lightning round I've got six questions for you are you ready yeah what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people one book is working backwards we covered that uh the other one that has shaped my uh my beliefs a lot is called how Brands grow as by Professor called Baron shop there two parts to it how Brands grow one and two that's both both very good uh the other book which I really love is and recently Kunal sha who's the founder of cred and Indian startup he suggested is the luxury strategy and and the reason why I love that book is because it gets into the depth of of the human psychology behind hierarchies and how Lords and kings and you know those kind of social hierarchies have shaped how people think about aspirational products and so on so highly recommended what's a favorite recent movie movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed I really like to do reruns of the office so so it's I was trying to think about this is what is the recent movie that I watch like no I keep on going back to the office in some other episode and try to drive a lot of um you know soles from Michael Scott and the okay the US one not the British one or do you watch both no I've watched both but but us one has like a lot more seasons do you have a favorite interview question that you like to ask candidates when you're maning product manager specific which are the products where you decide speed is more important versus which are products where you decide Excellence is what important and I think that gives me like a good understanding of their Frameworks and why they designing what and then we go back into concrete examples where they chose one versus the other and then go take it from there and then what do you look for in a good answer to that question I look for essentially their assessment of risk uh their assess ment of how important have they or how well have they assessed the market and the competition or the competitive products in that market and if they if their answerers let's ship something and we'll find out and so on that also gives me basically a point of view that they really don't understand that uh this product what they're talking about with the sh speed uh is not reach the the V part of the MVP it's not viable or it's not or I don't know how do you call it MLP or like whatever but it's not differentiated enough that it can be marketed it is not worth enough where where we can take it to User it's not going to work for a lazy when and selfish user and maybe that's not the answer towards U speed versus Excellence versus for example there's some product which are like there's a very clear competitive differentiation that we can find there was a clear Market Gap I wanted to launch something even if it is half it no problem I want to go take it out get user feedback I trate and so on so understanding of the market a but B also understanding of um their the core orientation com back to your uh ongoing advice of being full stack in a lot of ways and in this case being a full stack PM thinking about marketing launch and adoption all those things next question what is a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really like the very recent product that that I like is called rise it's a it's a sleep flacking app and because I am kind of an half Insomniac and for the longest time I was thinking about how can I track this so that what am I doing and how can I actually get better at this uh so I really like the way that they actually help help the end User it's just been a week since I've started using it what recommend it has that helped your sleep yet or too soon to say it's help it's helped me track my sleep so it's and now it's it's getting into the Zone where it is actionable but I like it okay okay we'll see do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to like to share with people kind of think about in either work or life would call it a life modotto as uh as much but but one of the things that I keep telling like you know my people who work with me alongside me and so on uh is stop externalizing that's one which also means the the more artistic way to say that is you are the reason for your own misery so that's something that keep using a lot more in a fun way but if things go wrong if that leadership meeting didn't happen that way if my product bombed and so on go back and let's ask ourselves what could we have done better what I could have done better and so on and of course because I'm also a poker player so so in a way I understand there is half luck involved and half skill uh but over a long period of time if it's only luck and you're failing and failing and failing you have to go and look back at your skill so yeah you are the reason for your own misery I love that advice be very empowering and be responsible final question I was stalking your LinkedIn you host an event called the secret secret Suare which is not that secret because you post about it but I'm curious just what is that all about and uh what got you to do these sorts of events so we just started like me and uh an ex of M shiwangi uh so we we essentially wanted to meet cool people around so that's how it started like interesting people uh without agenda who can come together and discuss interesting stuff about entrepreneurship about startups about products about Connections and so on so forth so it just started like that and now we are we are on to many many more interesting things that we are bringing in in terms of cohorts and which will be theme based so it could be around around
